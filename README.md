Found Bugs:
- During calibration, after GUI has been running for a while, channel 3 will not move at all when given the command to calibrate. Likewise, when given the command to pump, channel 3 will not move under the same circumstance occasion. Lowering the flowrate significantly remedies the problem.

When all three cheannels are set to recirulate, the stage should not be movng.

In recipe creator, "s/Sample" should be "sec/Sample".
